    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p id="main"> Hi, my name is Clare McAuliffe.</p>
    <p> I'm the youngest of four and some of my favorite memories are family dinners. Ever since I was little I loved to bake. It wasn't until high school that I really started 
      cooking. I tore my acl, mcl, and 
        minscus and had to take a year off of soccer. With so much free time I decided to spend it working and having fun in 
        my kitchen. This page is meant to give some insight to some of my favorite bloggers as well as some go to 
      recipes that my family and I now consider staples.</p>
      <p> On my instagram you can see a wide variety of foods I've made. I try to eat healthy for the most part but remain a firm believer 
        of balance in everything!</p>
