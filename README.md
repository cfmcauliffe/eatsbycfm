This is a personalized website I created from scatch using CSS, HTML, and Java. Intended for SI 339 Web Development. I really enjoy cooking and always have family members asking for me for my sauce recipes so I included some of my famous sauce recipes from salad dressings to a spicy peanut recipe! I also included some of my favorite bloggers, please take some time to visit their websites linked as much of my inspration comes from them.
